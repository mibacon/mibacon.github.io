In this poster I visualize the paradox presented by David Hilbert in 1924. 
A hotel with an infinite number of rooms is fully booked and a lone traveller shows up looking for a room. What at first seems an impossible task, providing accomodation to our new guest, becomes a quick fix when everyone is asked to just move over to the next room.
Subsquent impossible situations involving an infinite number of guests or an infinite number of infinite new guests prove to be similarly manageable.

Each guests' trek is captured as they make room for the new guests in each scenario.
