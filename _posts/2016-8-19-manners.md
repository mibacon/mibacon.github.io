An exercise assignment on speculative design.  
A future is imagined where courtesy is mandated by etiquette programs enforced by artificial intelligence and surveillance.

Unfortately, what I thought would be a utopian method for preventing man-spreading and other bad behavior quickly spiraled out of control.
As with all systems, those with financial means can exploit the system and choose to exhibit horrendous manners, while the rest of us are stuck in too-polite-after-you paralysis.
