I spent two weeks making uncomfortable eye-contact with strangers and recorded their reactions. 
Inspired by Marina Abramovic's performance in *The Artist is Present*, my experiment became more a window into my own pscyhe than my fellows.
I also discovered that one of the critical peices of Abramovic's experiment was a consenting partner. 

I created two versions of this project - one print and one mobile.

The print version focuses on the ephemeral experience of making connections with my neighbors.

Perhaps unconciously, the mobile version highlights the more creepy aspect of being watched, unwittingly by those around you.
