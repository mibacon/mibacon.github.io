I embarked on an intrepid task to collect a series of conversations with a chatbot. 
Several friends volunteered to engage in such conversations and I also added a fellow chatbot, A.L.I.C.E., to the mix.
For this project I wanted to juxstapose the bonkers topics with a refined aesthetic. 
The user must also scroll through the conversation to simulate the flow of the back-and-forth between the two parties.
